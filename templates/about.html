        <h2>About This Blog</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to my blog! I am very glad you find your way here. No matter whether you are 
          a computer scienctist yourself, just interested in topics around computer science, AI and data or you just got here by accident - 
          I hope you will find something interesting to read.
        </p>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>But first of all, let me tell you something about myself. I am NoÃ«l a computer scientist at University of Zurich and I am fascinated by any topics
          around computers, AI and data. I started this blog to share my thoughts, projects and insights with you. I am for sure not the best writer, neither 
          you will find the best programmer in me, but I rather see this as an opportunity to learn and grow, while sharing some interesting stuff with you.
          If you have any feedback, ideas or just want to say hi, feel free to reach out to me via the contact form.
